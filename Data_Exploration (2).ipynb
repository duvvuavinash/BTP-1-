              " (\"To be clear, The Science of the Quran is not just a book about science as it is found within the Quran but also presents a background on science and on Islam. Because of this, even readers who have no previous familiarity with this religion or with science will have no trouble following this book. One reason for this is the three-part formatting through which information is presented. The author starts by going over the Quran and some of its main themes, the life of the last prophet, and a bit of Islam's history in part one while including some of the prophet's sayings on a variety of topics. Then the author goes on to cover the nature of science and some science history while presenting some principles upon which he believes make up the structure of science.  I found this middle section of the book (part 2) to be somewhat unnecessary considering that part 3 of the book covers the science as it relates to the Quran with the verse translations and interpretations in the same small section. Also, some sections of this part were very general and self-explanatory to the point where leaving them out wouldn't have taken from the book. However, if you do not have a background in science or don't remember much from your science/history classes then you may like this section because it is a nice brief review.<br /><br />The significance of this book is in part 3 where the author goes over different fields of science and how the Quran contains some of the relatively recent discoveries despite being written over 1400 years ago. For me, this section was eye opening and the author's translation of the Quranic verses shed a new light on their meaning. I speak both arabic and english and the author successfully showed how slight nuances in translation can result in a whole new meaning to verses. Whether you are a muslim or not, scientist or not, everyone has something to learn from this book. You may not reach the same conclusions as the author because they are based on his interpretation of ayaat but you will think about Islam from a new perspective.\",\n",

I've taken time off from it to play some other games and have come back to it having forgotten the strategies I used so it's been fun relearning them.    The graphics are pretty good, I really can't speak to the graphics quality but I enjoy the special effects (the explosions, gun fire, ect).  The art style is appealing but not hyper realistic.      The game has great customization for the soldiers.  Some people care about that type of thing while others don't.  I personally enjoy working to advance my troops up through the ranks and trying to give each his or her own personal appearance.

Bought it in 2008 and had to have battery replaced in 2011. Now have to have battery replaced again (March, 2015), and decided to have TAG do it. So I sent to TAG for estimate, which cost me $35 insured through UPS. At first cheapest service they would offer that includes battery replacement was $95. Ouch! Then was told watch needed complete overhaul at $170. So that's $205 to replace the battery!!!!!!! Probably hadn't worn it 100 times since I've owned it (special occasions only), and it is in pristine condition. You can get the battery replaced anywhere, but if you want gaskets replaced, reputable jewelers will send it to TAG and probably charge you a premium for their time. IMHO, this is a BIG rip off by TAG's aftermarket service group in NJ. Definitely not going to buy another TAG for sure. Next watch will probably be Seiko dive watch of the &#34;Tuna&#34; variety which has much better movement, is water resistant to 300M, and is almost $200 cheaper. Consider yourself warned.\",\n",

Most of us keep our grass cut and the shrubs trimmed, but we often overlook the outside of the house itself. This is where a power washer can help and a good tool for the task is the AR Blue Clean AR390SS Cold Water Electric Pressure Washer.<br /><br />I have used power washers in the past but I never had one to call my own until now. This one is better than the power washers I have experienced previously and probably the main difference is the power. This power washer delivers a whopping 2000 psi of dirt- busting power, easily enough to eliminate the grime and other buildup on the sides of your house or your driveway. I was actually a little worried about the level of power and wondered if it would be too much. This made me hesitate a little at first, but once I started to clean, my worries vanished, my confidence increased, and I continued to wash my siding at a fast pace. You can, of course, dial down the pressure a little, but the 2000 psi is fine for most uses and makes the task of cleaning the siding or driveway that much easier and faster.<br /><br />This power washer comes with several attachments like a turbo nozzle, pencil nozzle, fan spray nozzle, and detergent nozzle. These different tips are an improvement compared to the power washers I have used in the past. They allow you to select the right tool for the task, for the best overall cleaning. I haven’t used any detergent or cleaner yet and have used primarily the turbo nozzle since it delivers the strongest stream of water. But it’s nice to know that the other options are available when I need them.<br /><br />I like the reel on this power washer and I like the ease of storage. The power cord is fine for my house because I have outside electrical outlets on each side of my house. If your home has fewer, you may need an extension cord. Other than that, I can’t find many bad things at all to say about this powerwasher.

It also protects the dash from the damage that the sun could do to it.  And, I think the mat adds a nice touch to the car's interior because it breaks up the monotony of plastic everywhere.  The mat that I bought is well made and fits like it should.  Very easy to install using the supplied velcro strips.  I highly recommend Dash Mats!\",\n",

This one is black and holds twelve AA batteries, which is ideal for storage in my camera bag for backup in the field.<br /><br />This caddy dispenses AA batteries one at a time so that you\\'re not fumbling when trying to load flash units or other devices, and it doesn\\'t take but seconds to figure out that this can be all be done in a one-handed fashion.  I\\'ve loaded it with my [[ASIN:B004UG41XW Sanyo eneloop AA Ni-MHRechargeable Batteries]], and they fit perfectly. The black contrasts quite well with the white eneloop cells, making it easy to tell at a glance how many batteries you have with you.  Because of the unique Storacell design, I can insert fresh cells positive side up and exhausted cells positive down, so that they don\\'t get mixed up.<br /><br />The Powerpax construction is quite robust, simple and highly functional.  The design is quite ingenious in that cells can be extracted singly and with one hand.  The material appears to be some form of sturdy polymer, and flip the battery holder over and you\\'ll see they\\'re a US-made product.<br /><br />What started this search for a better solution for battery storage was an incident during the winter, with snow on the ground.  It was cold and windy, and I was trying to get fresh AA batteries from a device quite similar in design to this [[ASIN:B003US4L4K AA battery storage box]].  I was shivering, and dropped the box, spilling all of the batteries in the snow, resulting in a dozen white eneloop Ni-MH cells falling into the snow.  I lost two of the batteries in the snow, and the one that I could retrieve were mixed up, fresh cells with exhausted.  Some considerable time was lost drying off the cells that I could locate, and even more time was lost testing them to see which were charged and which were exhausted.  After that I knew that there had to be a better solution, and this is just that.<br /><br />I\\'ve previously ordered the [[ASIN:B006IZKMYA Storacell by Powerpax Slim Line \"AA\" Battery Caddy, Clear]] that holds 4 AA batteries and the [[ASIN:B004YG7LEE Powerpax Slim Line \"AAA\" Battery Caddy, Yellow]], which holds 6 AAA batteries. Search around here and you\\'ll find that these are available in a number of colors that should match your needs, and most of the popular battery sizes are covered as well.<br /><br />This is a highly recommend 5-star solution for anyone looking for storage of those loose batteries that we all have, and why I came back for more of these.<br /><br />8/29/2012',\n",

It provides for a better fit in your iPhone 6 case, especially the cases with the built in battery packs.<br />You will get a HD ( high definition ) picture like none you have ever seen. The glass is rated 9H which is a very high rating for being scratch resistant. You will also see a big change since fingerprints and the oils they leave behind are a thing of the past.<br />The installation process is actually very easy but you must read the directions. You will find everything you need in the package. You start by cleaning off your phones screen with the wipe they enclosed, and then dry it. Then you line up the openings, and lay it down on the screen. You get no bubbles at all. If you need to move it you just carefully lift it off and do it again. There is no residue left behind. They did a great job with all the cutouts for the camera and everything else that made it easy to make everything line up.<br />You have to be crazy to use the old fashioned plastic sheets to protect your screen.

Not sure if this is really a con.<br /><br />I sold my $1000+ Nikon 85mm 1.4D and have never looked back. That lens focused slower, less accurate, and wasn't quite as sharp at 1.8.

For bathroom use, you can set humidistat and sensitivity, to fine tune how quickly your fan comes on during a shower and how long it stays off afterward.  These dials may also need to be adjusted depending on bathroom size.  You can also press the button to turn the fan on manually.  This then activates the adjustable timer (10-45min) countdown.  This manual mode is overridden when the sensor picks up humidity.  So, you could turn the fan on before you get in the shower, and then it will shutdown automatically afterward when the excess humidity is gone.<br /><br />They say that once you open the door to the bathroom, the sensor reacts differently.  As I like to leave the bathroom door open after a shower, I do wish there was a minimum run time you can set that would only count down after the humidity level returns to normal, to make sure you ran the fan long enough.  You can sort of do the same thing with the dials mentioned previously, but I think this way would be more surefire.<br /><br />If you don't have proper attic ventilation, and therefore have a fan in your attic window or through your roof, this device can be set up to cycle hourly in 10-45 min. increments as desired.  This could help you save on your electricity bill if your fan is providing more ventilation than necessary when run 100% of the time.  Ideally, you'd probably change your cycle time with the seasons.<br /><br />The device works very well.  As another reviewer warned, you do need full wiring to use this product, so check that out before taking on a retrofit installation.  Besides that, it offers a lot of different settings to allow this to be controlled in almost any way you like.  It's certainly the best type of fan control that I've seen available, and especially good if you have kids (or other people in the house) that don't like to run the fan with a shower for whatever reason; this can be set to force its use.  Fansin bathrooms have become code in most places for good reason; my house used to have no fans and the damage to the walls and everything else in the vicinity was quite tangible.  The entire house is in better shape and much more comfortable after installing and always using good ventilation fans.\",\n",

As the tale unravels, one of the group is killed and Casca begins to investigate, who was it? As the clues drop he begins to suspect that all is not as it seems.<br /><br />Not everyone is who they claim they are, and it was a fascinating and brutal end to the story.

They have a nice, healthy taste to them - not overly salty or oily, and I love the addition of the seeds. Btw, the seeds aren't obtrusive or make them more difficult to eat. Instead, they just add some nice additional taste to the corn. Although not triangular like a lot of tortilla chips, the shape is still good for dipping into salsa.<br /><br />I enjoy these chips either with salsa or simply plain.

People will inevitably call it Faulknerian - it\\'s Deep South, it\\'s hot, it\\'s told through the lens of a boy who\\'s neurologically atypical. And it\\'s got fruit and blood. But if you have any spiritual antennae at all, you\\'ll quickly grasp that it\\'s anti-Faulkner. There\\'s fullness, not emptiness, in back of everything.<br /><br />And the story is backwards, too. Christianity first made its way by claiming the crucifixion and resurrection as the answer to evil. But this novel turns that upside down: in this the novel the crucifixion (at least) is the evil that must be answered. Pip knows at once, in his chaotic, inarticulate way, that everyone is responsible for the death of his brother. The question is, how do you find your way, hobbled with knowing that? Christianity here is the question, not the answer.<br /><br />-------<br /><br />\\'\"Light,\" he whispered. He would collect, slowly and laboriously, a sufficient radiance.\\'<br /><br />So Pip\\'s story goes on, to the scary parts: where he goes about collecting light. Of course he does, because that\\'s what human beings do: but Pip\\'s working under such a deficit that he has no real thought for what it\\'s going to do to other people, and to himself eventually, if he simply makes up his own rules and plunders it. Here\\'s where the book turns into a book about me, and I find myself reluctant to pick it back up: at twilight the camellia on the cover hovers like a ghost on the end table.<br /><br />-----<br /><br />It takes a long slow weary time to become human, for some of us. \"I preach the Church of the Bitter End and the news of your guilt, boy.\" I\\'m loving Marly\\'s White Camelia: the story of Pip\\'s slow coming-to-humanity cuts close to the bone, for me. It\\'s always been too easy for me to cut free of ties, to shrug and wonder if any of it matters, really, to lose myself in the sheer welter of the senses, the building of patterns and their collapse.<br /><br />-----<br /><br />I don\\'t often read novels about myself. Oh, sure, all novels are about me: I am Jane Eyre, David Copperfield, and Ishmael - not to mention Rochester and Micawber and Ahab - and so are you; but that\\'s only because we all are. It\\'s only once in decade, maybe, that I meet myself in a novel in a more personal way, so as to turn red and plus myself non: I didn\\'t know anyone knew this about me. Tolstoy wrote a monstrous great novel about me, calling me Pierre Kirillovich Bezukhov; Trollope once gracefully eviscerated me under the name of Bertie Stanhope. But no one had written about my childhood and coming-of-age, which was a grimmer story than either Tolstoy or Trollope had in mind. Suppose you are a boy of ferocious will and intense desire. Suppose there is an early overwhelming loss, a hole where the center of your life should be. Suppose what is difficult for other people is easy for you, while what\\'s easy for them is impossible: you can solve quadratic equations in your head, but you can\\'t remember the names of the other kids in your classroom. Suppose the sensual world is overwhelming, full of beauties and patterns, while the social world is full of puzzling, trivial detail. Suppose you are awkward, clumsy, irritating: and yet, when whispering time comes, possessed of an eldritch capacity for persuasion. Suppose your own vulnerabilities are so different from other people\\'s that you regularly wound, and are wounded, without anybody meaning any harm. How do you grow up? And how do you recover from a deep, precocious understanding of evil, which - for all your immaturity - marks you as old?<br /><br />Well, by blundering about, and doing a fair amount of damage; by lots of dumb luck, and by the grace of strangers who are extraordinarily generous and kind. That\\'s my story, and it\\'s Pip Tatnall\\'s too. I cared enough about the outcome of this novel that when I was twenty pages from the end I suddenly stopped, and put off finishing it for several days. I was afraid it would end badly, and I couldn\\'t have stood that.<br /><br />It doesn\\'t end badly. But \\'nuff said.',\n",

For example, the author would introduce a character but you would never see that character mentioned in the rest of the book.

              " (\"I'm almost speechless this product is so good ... wow. Extremely heavy duty, not hard to install at all(*), works like a champ! I purchased two pairs of these, ran them 49&#34; wide (inside-to-inside) so I could fit a piece of 4' wide plywood on them, spaced them every other joist or 32&#34; o.c., so spanned a total of 96&#34;, and sure enough, my 8' plywood fit with only breath to spare, but it fit. I will never, I mean never load these things near to their limit, what with the little bit of scrap lumber, plywood, etc I'll put on them. I mean seriously, I was shocked at just how heavy duty these things are, way more than what it looked like in the pics.<br /><br />(*) Though it has zero to do with the quality or design of these brackets at all, I just have to share that dang, I had a devil of a time finding my joists perfectly, and I consider myself pretty good at that generally. Hopefully you'll have better luck than me but, at least be prepared ... I got so-o frustrated. The biggest issue I had was being on an 8' ladder and reaching to that 12' ceiling of mine, the max reach for that height ladder. Made me dizzy as all get out, which certainly didn't help as I kept thinking I had the joist from my finder, only to poke a small test hole with my drill to find air behind my spot ... whew, long, laborious work. I'm sure it would have been less stressful had I been working with shorter ceiling height.<br /><br />Oh yeah, while I could give you a ton of tiny tips, I'll give you this one - don't use a pencil to mark where to drill your pilot holes, but instead use a small-medium point magic marker. I learned that trick over half way thru and was ticked I hadn't thought of it sooner, for it is very difficult to hold that rod to the ceiling and keep it perfectly still while you mark thru the holes, and swirling that pencil around to mark the spots just begged for that thing to jump all over the place, whereas the marker made a quick dot and was done, and better to boot.<br /><br />Along those lines, another tip is, mark only the two holes closest to the vertical pole, take it down and drill those two holes, mount the bracket with those two, then drill the two remaining pilot holes with it attached, finishing by putting the last two screws in those holes. This works great for not only is marking all 4 holes before mounting just asking for 1 to 2 of them to be off and causing you great difficulty, if you do the outside 2 first like I did at first, you'll next find that drilling the closer-in pilot holes after the pole is installed (with first only the outside two screws) is next to impossible for the drill is just too fat to get that close to the pole on those last two. Trust me, you're probably having a tough time visualizing that right now but once you get into it, you'll say to yourself, &#34;oh, so that's what he was talking about.&#34;<br /><br />Good luck, hope you enjoy yours as much as I do mine - yea!!\",\n",

With it being Mid December, we have about 5-6 inches of soft but coarse snow and another 2-3 inches of hard packed snow on top of that and there's also about two inches of ice on top of that. So as you can imagine, I put this snow blower to the test right away. I was very pleased to find that it wasn't very loud at all, I would say it's about the same as our vacuum cleaner, maybe even a little quieter. I got going on our front deck and was happy to see that the snow was being thrown well into the yard and away from the deck, I would say about 20-25 feet! I will say that due to the light weight of the unit, it did take a little muscle to push the snow blower into the hard packed snow and ice in some spots. I quickly learned that if you let the blade chew or ease it's way into the snow, you can make some pretty good progress. The motor was more than adequate for the snow, packed snow and ice combination that I was clearing from my deck. After reading some reviews that said that they had problems with the snow chute, to my surprise, the chute was fairly easy to adjust and the snow blower made quick work of a task that would usuallytake about a half hour. It probably cleared the deck in about half the time it would take with a shovel, but the best part was that it only took about 1/4 of the effort! Soon, I was clearing a spot where our garbage cans sit and then I was off to make a path to our satellite, which seems to get clogged up with snow ALL of the time. Next, I was clearing a path to our propane tank and then to the shelter that holds our portable generator. I was pleased that this usually tiresome and daunting task was already done, all with minimal effort.<br /><br />One thing I did learn almost immediately is that you better make sure everything is cleared from your path. This snow blower will chew up and spit up anything in it's path!! My son is minus a few less toy plastic trucks that I didn't see under the snow and all of them were chewed up and shot about 20 feet away!! I have yet to finish clearing the back deck and will then be moving on up to the roof to clear it off also. I hope this review helps someone, because at this point I can say so far, so good!\",\n",

I enjoy building the 16 space fighters set with him (thanks to the simple and easy instructions which came with it) and it’s a great fun. Also he creates some of his own using his imagination, so now me and my son are constantly building new things. He just doesn’t seem to get tired of it. I’m really impressed by Laser Pegs as they are giving such an amazing lego building set in such an amazing price.

The first would have been more information about his relationship with his two children. And the second would have been more information about the relationship with his wife, Nell.<br /><br />Otherwise, this is almost like being a friend of Wooden's during most of his life. It had quite a bit on information about his early life, his time at Purdue and the period at ISU, etc. I live on the south side of Indianapolis and worked for about a year as a pharmacist at the hospital in Martinsville. One of my best friends from Westfield High School was a big fan of his growing up - had his success pyramid on his bedroom wall, etc.<br /><br />Since I played football, track and baseball, I was mainly interested in his teams always wining the NCAA men's Basketball championship, seemingly every year. I lived barely a hour from Purdue while growing up. Once married I live barely an hour from where he grew up. When I attended my one year at ISU I was unaware that he had coached there for 3 years. And I graduated from Butler University and I knew Tony Hinkle quite well. I grew up with Bobby Plump and Hoosier Hysteria.<br /><br />But I never knew of his glory days playing at Purdue nor of his barnstorming days in the early pro leagues.<br /><br />This book is rich in detail and I highly recommend this book to nearly everyone. You don't have to be a sports fan to enjoy this book. Coach Wooden is quite simply an icon in Indiana as well as the sports world.

Both McConaughey and Harrelson are perfect as the loner-atheist iconoclast thrust into a partnership with the seemingly happily married man who believes in everything he should. After ten years, the discovery of another body killed in a style exactly like that of the murderer they apprehended brings them back together to be interrogated about the particulars of the original case. Contrasting their present positions in life and beliefs with their former ones, it's a chronicle of flawed characters searching for an even more broken one. (I really felt McConaughey's character, being the man full of esoteric knowledge,  should've reconized the symbolism of the antlers, however, but that might've ruins it as far as the length of the series.)<br /><br />This review is for Disc One but I have no doubts it will stand for the other discs also, and if my hunch is correct about the story's outcome...WOW!\",\n",

I ordered two of these and have one right above my front door (for finding my keys that bit easier when I arrive home), and also one by my gate (so anyone coming in at night has some light to illuminate the path to the door). Let's also not forget they are a good security option for informing you of people approaching when put out of arms reach. The light gives off a dim glow throughout the night and switches to a really bright LED option when the motion sensor picks up movement. The light then turns back to it's dim setting around 10 seconds after. Perfect! The best part about these is their green energy efficiency where they charge throughout the day via the solar panel on the top of them.

New drivers who are cautious can quickly become very nervous when other drivers are too close, both along the side or from behind.  When rude drivers started honking, riding the bumper, or cutting quickly in front of her while learning to drive, the behavior changed once we started using the signs.  The signs are easily recognized and can be placed on the car with enough magnetic force that I don't worry about them flying off.  And other drivers seem to be a little more patient or stay farther way.  This has greatly reduced the stress of learning to drive around others.

I know the reviews are going to be wordy with all the detail and description needed.  It's now time to put on my big girl boots and just get it over with.<br /><br />The basics... Draculaura comes with a stand, hairbrush and a small cardboard card .  A Ghoul's Rule, DVD animation still of Draculaura is on one side. The other side has movie versions of Cleo, Clawdeen, Frankie and Draculaura.<br /><br />At first I was resistant of these dolls, since they were a bit expensive and I was using all spare amounts of cash to find the older MH Dolls I wanted to have in my collection. After eying them for months in various stores I finally caved and bought most of the set. Ever the faithful Frankie fan I rarely find another doll prettier, however this Draculaura steals the show in the Ghoul's rule set.<br /><br />Draculaura wears the dress from the Ghoul's Rule DVD every detail expertly matched.  The dress has a white ruched bodice with off the shoulder sheer black sleeves. The large pink collar of her dress along with the black ribboning is plastic and removable, functioning more like a necklace This enables the dress too go from Gothic couture too regular couture with it's removal.<br /><br />The mini skirt of her dress is comprised of three layers. The top most layer is sheer black tulle with a velvet, bat winged, heart design. From the sides and back of black tulle stems a longer train of sheer black fabric, the metallic silver and pink in the spiderweb, vine design, shimmers in the light. The second layer is a shimmering pink that sits atop the third  and final layer of sheen pink.<br /><br />Draculaura sports sheer hot pink tights that fade to black, mid calf. Her shoes perfectly match her attire, being clear with black spiderweb design and  pink,zipper detailing. The actual heel of her shoe is solid black and looks similar to a fang.<br /><br />The wings of Draculaura's outfit are fitted onto her shoulders and like the collar are re-movable. The large bat wings are black  which fades to pink as it gets closer to the tips. A see-through spider web design is cut into the moveable wings. ( Yep, that's right! You can pose the wings to the sides, straight back or somewhere in the middle.)<br /><br />Counted among her other accessories are a small skullette doll, a pink skullette trick or treat basket and her black and pink masquerade mask. I am happy to report the doll can hold the mask independently and is easily posed with it.<br /><br />Draculaura's hair is a huge misfire however. The wig is long and full but the tight spiral curls are a mess after getting her un-boxed. Brushing out the curls only makes them frizzy. This is one of the few times I wish Mattel heavily sprayed a doll's wig. This particular Draculaura also only has one single streak of trademark pink rooted  into the black wig The streak accompanies the pink found in her midnight black bangs.<br /><br />Overall I love this doll! Very happy to have her in my collection. As with any of the deluxe MH dolls. I feel like they are made more for the older MH fans as opposed to the younger ones. The Outfits are very sensitive to play and small pieces can be easily lost or broken.  If you don't have this Draculaura and your a fan of the Character...Pick her up Today!!!\",\n",

I went to Graco's website and still had a hard time telling why some cost more than others and I always find that it's something silly like adjustable height for the handle or something.  I have this system [[ASIN:B00ASI748K Graco FastAction Fold Click Connect Travel System/Click Connect 30, Finley]] to compare to.    So what do you get?  A car seat.  A base for the car seat.  A stroller.    The stroller is going to have the most feature difference between all the travel systems.  This stroller has one hand closing system. There is a button in the middle of the handlebar of the stroller that you push. Turn the the handle (where the button is attached) and then let go. Then you can use the same hand to pull the tray towards you and it closes. And it stays upright.    I can't open it one-handed though.    The other Graco system I mentioned above had the handle in the base of the stroller that you pull and and it folds (almost lifting it). I like this one better.    This system has locks for the front wheels if you don't want them to swivel (manual mentions grass).    The storage area is bigger on this system.    The base is different also. The old base I have has a bubble-level to get the seat in the car at the right angle. The problem with that is that there is so much leeway that it was useless.    This system does away with the bubble and has a red line on the base that must be level with the ground. I would get a level and hold it against that red line.    The car seat is good (and pretty much the same as other snugrides) and highly recommended from multiple sources.    The click-connect is really nice and we can use the old bases we have.\",\n",

I\\'m putting it up top, because I want to share my recent success in getting six mice in three days with this zapper -- finally wiping out the last of the group that had taken over my kitchen. (I think. I still have it baited and ready just in case.)<br /><br />I accomplished this by trying a new bait technique. (Inspired by another reviewer who mentioned baiting his with boiled chicken, and one more reviewer who mentioned leaving them baited but turned off initially, so the varmints got use to it first.) What I did was shred up a little leftover meat (chicken, turkey or beef) and put one chunk down at the far end, as instructed to set off the trap. But also put another shred about a third of the way in, just over the first diagonal bar in the \"floor,\" where it wouldn\\'t trigger the current yet.<br /><br />I put the trap in places where I knew they looked for food. But seeing the results of this baiting method, I almost think it would be a good idea to put a little bait outside it as well, if I didn\\'t know exactly where to put it.<br /><br />This is the first time in a month I haven\\'t heard rustling in the kitchen when I\\'m not in the room. I\\'m very pleased with this trap.<br /><br />Here\\'s my older review:<br /><br />Despite the title on this item, this is a Raticator.<br /><br />I live in the country surrounded by woods. When field mice found a way into the house this year, I bought one of these and a couple of smaller mouse-size electrical traps. (I have dogs so poison was out of the question, and I worried about old-fashioned mousetraps being inhumane.)<br /><br />Both have performed well, getting about a mouse a week, but the Raticator killed big mice that would have never wedged their way into the smaller traps.<br /><br />This trap is simple to set up. The only work is putting in the batteries, then finding the right spots to put them and the right bait. The bait that works at my house is a smidge of sunflower butter on alittle corner of bread. I slip it into the back on the tip of a table knife (with the current turned off, of course).<br /><br />It\\'s also easy to get rid of the dead mice, and re-use immediately. They can also be cleaned when necessary. You can find instructions on the internet.<br /><br />The customer service is excellent. They answer the phone, give you advice, and send extra instructions (like how to test it) if you need it.<br /><br />Raticator works for me and I\\'m glad I spent the money on it.',\n",

In reading reviews I came across two common complaints on popular video monitors that I would like to address in reference to this video monitor- you CAN turn the volume all the way down on this monitor if you just want to see your child and not hear him/her (we have a small house turning on the volume is overkill) and if you have it plugged in, the video part of the monitor will stay on(for example, I leave mine plugged in on my nightstand- it also has quite a long cord so it will reach far-away outlets).    The only three minor issues I have so far is that this does not have a belt clip and my pockets are too small to carry it around, it does have a little kickstand so you can prop it up on a flat surface, though. Although we can see most of the crib, we have been unable so far to angle the camera (and have not figured out how to mount it) so that we can see ALL of the crib, although I do not think any monitor would have been able to give us a 100% full view of the crib, due to the layout of our nursery. My husbands biggest gripe is that the zoom is not a variable zoom- the only options under zoom are 1x and 2x and because this model cannot tilt and pan remotely, it makes it pretty much useless unless your child is in exactly the right position/you have positioned the monitor perfectly.    ** UPDATE 3 months later: Still love it! I make sure to turn off both parts of the monitor while not in use as it was suggested by other reviewers that that may contribute to some of the units prematurely malfunctioning. I did notice that if you play the lullabies via the monitor for very long, it gets pretty warm (warm enough to perhaps damage the unit if it was too warm too often too long, but not warm enough to do damage to anything else).    ** UPDATE almost 2 years later: Still love it. I am certain there are better monitors out there now, but we are sticking with this one, in fact, we are going to buy an additional camera for baby #2!\",\n",

              " ('I have been steeped in digital photography for over a decade and have quite a few cameras to fit my needs.  I\\'m not a totally gear-head - I do tend to prefer cameras that work well in pure automatic mode, reserving manual fine tuning for rare occasions.  In other words, a camera that is only serviceable via RAW mode is no use for me.  I have three cameras in my arsenal right now, the [[ASIN:B0075SUFLE Canon PowerShot A4000IS 16.0 MP Digital Camera with 8x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom 28mm Wide-Angle Lens with 720p HD Video Recording and 3.0-Inch LCD (Red)]], [[ASIN:B005MTME3U Canon PowerShot S100 12.1 MP Digital Camera with 5x Wide-Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom (Black)]], and the [[ASIN:B0002XQJFA Canon EOS 20D 8.2MP Digital SLR Camera with EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 Lens]].  The A4000IS is really the camera for the kids, but the S100 is my pocket camera and the 20D DSLR is my good camera for when I don\\'t mind the weight.<br /><br />So where does the Fuji H50EXR fit into this picture?  This is a bridge camera, with the body profile of a DSLR, but the lens is not interchangeable and the cost is far less.  There are plenty of extensive reviews on the web, so I\\'m hoping my review can provide insight beyond the encyclopedic coverage on features you will never use.<br /><br />In short, this camera has three strong points going for it - the 42x zoom, the 24mm wide angle, and the f2.8 aperture opening.  That\\'s not to say there aren\\'t other great features (like a bright LCD, HD movie recording, etc), but those are what sets it out at this price point.<br /><br />Most people know why 42x zoom is important.  Note that this is a purely optical zoom, not digital.  Digital zoom just takes a high resolution photo and pre-crops it.  Optical zoom preserves the image quality.  With the 1000mm lens, you can zoom into far away objects quite easily.  The zoom is manual, a nice feature when zooming during a video, or when you need to zoom quickly.  Many cameras are near useless at maxmium zoom without a tripod because the image blurs, but the built-in image stabilization means that the 42x is quite usable.<br /><br />It is also nice that the lens can go to 24mm.  That means you can do easier shots indoors when the subject is near you - this is effectively a wide-angle or macro-type setting.  Many super zoom lenses cannot also do the 24mm setting.<br /><br />So what is f2.8 and why should you care?  The f-setting refers to how wide the aperture can open.  While the f2.8 only applies at the widest setting, it is significantly better than competing cameras, many of which are closer to f3.5.  In dark rooms, a camera with a lower f-setting will let in more light and get lighter pictures with shorter exposure time.<br /><br />What else does the camera offer?  It has some cool features such as a built-in panorama stitch mode and a 480fps movie mode for making slow-motion videos.  These features are mostly for fun.  The panorama stitch mode unfortunately only does vertical resolution of 1080 pixels, or less than 1/3 the normal vertical resolution of a still photo.  The 480fps mode also is extremely low resolution and is neat, but almost unusable as the video is so hard to see.<br /><br />There are some facts of life with this camera.  You can\\'t get a pitcher of orange juice from one orange, nor can you get the best images from a small sensor and smaller optics.  The sensor is small, only 1/2\", which means that images will have more noise than DSLR cameras with larger sensors.  While large sensors have started to filter into the lower-end space, they don\\'t come in cameras that have 42x zooms or cost less than $500.  Camera specifications for a given price range have give and take.  The [[ASIN:B00BF9MUAS Sony NEX-3NL/W Compact Interchangeable Lens Digital Camera Kit (White)]] might have a large beautiful sensor, but the kit lens is only 55mm, not 1000mm.  Add on a better lens and you\\'re into DSLR territory.  In short, a camera must be evaluated on imagequality within the price range of the camera.<br /><br />There are some similar market competitors with even better zooms for similar camera bodies, but of course many don\\'t have all of the extra features like panorama or the really wide aperture.<br /><br />All of that being said, it\\'s a 4 star camera.  I was disappointed that they didn\\'t include a manual and I had to download it off the web.  I couldn\\'t find any method to show a histogram of the picture during review, a useful feature to know if the photo is properly exposed.  It has since been pointed out to me how to do it, so I can say it does have histogram, but I still couldn\\'t find it easily.  The camera screen also didn\\'t give me useful feedback in manual mode to know if the picture would be properly exposed once taken as I adjusted the aperture and shutter speed.  I had to click and find out.  A manual focus wheel, a multi-purpose adjust dial, and a \"quick\" menu are a manual do-it-yourselfer\\'s dream, but you will take some time to get used to these.<br /><br />I also found the user interface a little cumbersome.  Given that this is a new camera, it\\'s about time they went touchscreen and got rid of all of these buttons.  Browsing and zooming on photos you took requires two buttons near the front of the top and the scroll wheel on the back.  In quite a few uses, you will find yourself going all over the camera looking for the right button.  I acknowledge that some of this may be familiarity - I know Canon better than Fuji - it just seems that they didn\\'t make this as easy as they could have for new photographers.  The interface just felt clunky and not well organized.<br /><br />Other shortcomings?  The flash must be manually opened and the zoom is also a little stiff compared to my DSLR to turn.  Truthfully, the camera is surprisingly heavy for its position as a bridge camera.  It\\'s honestly not much lighter than my DSLR, and when I went out with it on a hike today, wondered why I didn\\'t just bring my DSLRalong.  Granted, I normally carry a 270mm lens and not a 1000mm one, but I was still surprised by the weight.  That being said, not everyone can afford a DSLR, making this an excellent choice as a value high-end camera.<br /><br />Despite smaller shortcomings, this is a nice camera that you can take from the box, put into \"auto\" mode, and start taking nice photos.  If you value the 1000x zoom, the f2.8 setting, and the lower cost, it is a fine choice for general purpose use and for a low-cost alternative to a DSLR that gets you a wide aperture and excellent zoom.',\n",

Unfortunately, Mother Nature conspired to not snow very much here in southern Nevada last winter and limited our time in the snow.  This year; however, is a different story. A friend and I traveled to Bryce Canyon and Cedar Breaks National Monument during Veteran's Day weekend.  We drove into a significant snow storm and after the weather cleared we hiked in fresh snow at Cedar Breaks.  Long story short, I'm glad we packed the gaiters for the trip.  Cedar Break's recieved over two feet snow during the storm and got the chance to use the gaiters over our hiking boots.  Overall, these gaiters did the trick during the hiking at 10,000ft keeping us dry in deep snow - these gaiters ride high up to the knee which is perfect for tall folks, like me.  The only miss with these gaiters are the strapping mechanism going under the boots, essentially, a string that needs to knotted.  It was a little challenging squaring away the knot when the air temperature was around 0 dgs, but, we were able to get the gaiters secured and we move about the mountain with the greatest of easy and comfort.

              " (\"I have used WD black and RE4 (now just RE) drives for many years. I've probably used more than 100 in my desktops and light use servers and that many again in client desktops/servers. My overall experience has been excellent and this drive, so far, is no exception.<br /><br />After a week with the WD2003FZEX my first impressions are below. I'll update the review as I've lived with the drive for a while and share what I learn.<br /><br />I installed the WD2003FZEX 2TB WD Black drive into a Dell T7500 Precision Workstation. It is being used for data and is not the boot drive which is a [[ASIN:B00CKAOWB6 Seagate 600 series SSD]] that is very fast but power hungry for a SSD: good for desktops, not as much for laptops/tablets.<br /><br />I tried both the built-in SATA2 and an add-in card with SATA3. In all cases Installation was painless and uneventful. The different interfaces did not yield dramatically different results.<br /><br />To get an handle on how this drive's performance changes from the last version I ran some tests on this drive and a older [[ASIN:B004CSIFFS Caviar Black 750 GB SATA III 7200 RPM 64MB - WD7502AAEX]] for comparison.<br /><br />In running casual tests (copying large files, directories of small files, etc.) I got some general impressions of the drive:<br /><br />1) In both large files and small file copies to/from the FZEX outperforms the older AAEX but mostly shines with small file/random access. I believe the improvement for small file/random access is close to 10%. Some of this might be the dual processor and improved caching over older versions.<br /><br />2) it's more noisy than previous versions as has been noted in other reviews. It seems that is a fairly consistent pattern for rotating media drives: faster=noisier.<br /><br />3) The drive runs slightly warm - meaning comfortably warm to the touch. Good for longevity and unusual for a performance drive.<br /><br />The WD Black line of drives comes with a 5 year warranty. I have had few failues with WD drives but when they have happened I have never had a problem with warranty. This has not been so true with other manufacturers (You can read about this in my review of the [[ASIN:B00691WMJG Seagate Momentus XT 750GB Hybrid Drive]]). With a business where I run a lot of hard drives this matters. Warranty is nothing until you need it, then it's everything.<br /><br />The FZEX is a consistent step in the long evolution and ongoing improvement of the WD Black line drives. For consistent quality I have to give this drive 5 stars.<br /><br />Hope this paints a helpful picture of what the drive delivers.<br /><br />Update: Dec 27, 2013<br /><br />After living with the 2TB black drive for a while it seems more quiet than at first. This might be the drive, but I think more likely me just getting used to it. So far no issues or glitches. It is operating perfectly and still feels faster than my older WD Black line drives. I'm still quite satisfied.<br /><br />Another option from WD that is a little unusual and works in laptops and may also be good for compact desktops or all-in-one's is the [[ASIN:B00GSJ9X4Q Black2 Dual Drive 2.5&#34; 120 GB SSD + 1 TB HDD]]. This provides an OS sized 120GB SSD and 1TB HDD in one laptop sized package. This is different from hybrid drives. It uses one 2.5&#34; format package to implement the popular desktop combo of a SSD for the OS and a conventional drive for bulk data. It's on the expensive side but is a good solution for a combination of speed and bulk data. I installed this for a client who does video editing on a laptop.\",\n",

              " (\"I've attended many traditional tea ceremonies, including ones in Japan. In the tea house I went to in Kyoto there was a tea class that explained how to properly prepare matcha. If you are looking for tea to create an authentic ceremony then I would highly recommend this tea. When I prepared this tea it brought me back to the tea house in Kyoto. I would prepare this tea for guests, exchange students, conducting a ceremony, and when teaching about Japanese culture.<br /><br />At Japanese tea ceremonies the most important thing is the green tea. Ceremonial tea grade matcha is the highest quality powdered green tea. When you open the container you can see and smell the quality. When I opened this package I could tell that the matcha was great quality. The smell wasn't bitter, but lightly sweet, and it smelled like grass. The power is fine, soft, and pure green. It did not stick to the package sides and slide easily out into the cup. The taste is a mixture of slightly bitter and similar to barley. It also has a unique flavor itself that I can only describe as matcha itself.<br /><br />When you make green tea from powder you need to consider how to make it properly. A cup that is shaped like a bowl is appropriate for traditional ceremonies, and you would need a bamboo whisk to stir the powder and water. It should froth at the top while you whisk, and after you whisk. If you like stronger tea then the entire pouch is good for one cup, but if you don't like strong tea then only use half of it. The water shouldn't be boiling hot, but just before the boiling point. If it is too hot it will take away from the flavor, and if it is too cold it will be extremely bitter and clump together. If you're just drinking this in a regular mug you should be cautious with how strong you are making the matcha, and stir it with a regular utensil. Make sure to stir thoroughly so that you don't leave any clumps in the cup.<br /><br />When drinking this tea you should finish it in one sitting. If you let the tea become cold it will increase in bitterness and become unpleasant. It is rude to not finish a cup of tea during a traditional ceremony, and the last sip should be a long one. If you haven't attended a ceremony but want to prepare one I suggest watching a video first because there are many steps to making the perfect cup of tea. The cup, whisk, scooper, kettle, and tea can make the difference in preparation for a ceremony. With this tea it is important to have the other components be top quality to enjoy the tea at its best.<br /><br />This grade of tea doesn't need anything added but water. You shouldn't add sugar to this tea, or lemon, or anything else. If you think it is too bitter then you should eat sweets while drinking it. Youkan is the traditional Japanese bean paste sweet to have with matcha. The sweets will curve the bitterness and make the experience more enjoyable.<br /><br />If you are wanting to make green tea ice cream I suggest staying with this brand, but consider using a lower grade of tea. It still works with ceremonial grade, but it seems like a waste to use such high quality tea for something else. Adding some powder on top of vanilla ice cream tastes amazing. There are more uses for green tea than just drinking it, though with this grade of green tea the best way is to drink it.\",\n",

Few people, including two different furnace guys I've worked with, have the slightest idea that it takes 3 wires for a furnace to provide top functioning, but it does.

              " (\"When I saw Meryl Streep play the seemingly facile Omaha housewife she portrays in this 2012 marital dramedy, I had an immediate flashback to an underrated romantic drama she did almost thirty years ago, Ulu Grosbard's [[ASIN:B0018RC7QE Falling in Love]] (1984), in which she played a young married woman who couldn't help falling for a married architect (Robert De Niro) on a commuter train. I kept thinking of Kay as that earlier character all these years later trying to fan the embers of the passion that erupted so unpredictably back then. Interestingly, her younger character could not consummate the affair either but fell hopelessly in love anyway. Director David Frankel ([[ASIN:B000MKD9P6 The Devil Wears Prada]]) and first-time screenwriter Vanessa Taylor travel to the opposite end of the marital spectrum, a 31-year-old marriage that finds Kay and her accountant husband Arnold sleeping in separate bedrooms having long ago lost any sense of intimacy and passion their marriage once had. The film begins with a seriocomic preface in which Kay awkwardly tries to seduce Arnold, an invitation he rebuffs with the flimsiest of excuses. Knowing their marriage is on auto-pilot, she fears being alone emotionally and ending their lives in emotional isolation now as they go through the motions in their sixties.<br /><br />An optimist despite the odds, Kay signs them up for a week of intensive couples therapy in Great Hope Springs, Maine, where renowned therapist Dr. Bernie Feld practices. Arnold is predictably resistant but begrudgingly accompanies her when he realizes how serious Kay is about the counseling. The sessions with Dr. Feld initially don't go well with Arnold protesting the doctor's every recommendation for building intimacy in his relationship with Kay. This is when the movie becomes the most surprising because every time a physically awkward moment presents itself, the feelings become heartfelt and sometimes humorous in unexpected ways. While Frankel and Taylor handle the slim story turns with genuine insight, it's the masterful work of Streep and Tommy Lee Jones that elevates the film into an experience that far transcends the Lifetime-TV orientation you would expect otherwise. Unafraid to come across as harshly judgmental, Jones has made a career of playing dyspeptic curmudgeons, so it's nice to see him gradually reveal Arnold's vulnerabilities with skill and delicacy. He has to play Arnold close to the vest but not so insular as to make you wonder what Kay saw in him in the first place. After tackling larger-than-life figures like Julia Child and Margaret Thatcher, Streep is splendid portraying a sheltered woman who contributes as much to the fossilized, inchoate marriage as Arnold does.<br /><br />At 63, the actress allows herself to look even beyond her age, but she's still beautiful in a shopworn way. I love how she almost swallows every word she speaks as if Kay's tentative nature is holding back grand expectations of a romance she can only fantasize about. The two veteran actors have a natural rapport that gives the viewer a rooting interest in seeing them overcome their age-old emotional and physical barriers. There are moments between them especially in the film's last third that are quite heartbreaking, especially when they come to learn that they aren't the people they believed themselves, or each other, to be. Steve Carell plays Feld straight-up without an iota of irony, and his clinical approach works effectively within this context. The rest of the supporting cast makes very little impact, including Jean Smart as Kay's sassy manager at the Coldwater Creek she works part-time, Elisabeth Shue as an equally sassy barmaid counseling Kay on sex, and Mimi Rogers as the final payoff of a joke about a comely (and yes, sassy) neighbor with a trio of corgis. The young actors who play Kay and Arnold's adult children are barely present, but I'm sure that was part of the intention in order to allow complete focus on the couple. Frankel overdoes the soundtrack music when moments of silence would have been far more effective, but otherwise, the tone feels spot-on.\",\n",

If you are looking for a more dramatic and action-packed fact-based thriller, you may find Bigelow\\'s slow-paced narrative style frustrating. Sometimes there are so many details going on, that though each sequence is absorbing, the 157-film film itself feels too long and uneven.<br /><br />Jessica Chastain plays Maya, the film\\'s protagonist about whom we know nothing about, except that she is determined to track down Osama bin Laden. Chastain\\'s strong acting effectively shows us the change her character must undergo over the course of the investigation, though the reason for her determination, or obsession, is not explained.<br /><br />Some reviewers compare the semi-documentary approach of \"Zero Dark Thirty\" to that of \"Zodiac,\" a David Fincher film made in 2007. In both, we audiences know where the film is going. We expect the process of revealing the truth to be concise and clear (possibly with a character we can identify with), while the film gives only detailed accounts of events, which mat look real but feel drawn-out.<br /><br />Though I prefer a more accessible approach with a faster narrative and characters with back stories, I found \"Zero Dark Thirty\" to be a rewarding experience, even though I admit I had to be very patient at times trying to follow the narrative thread.',\n",

Of course, if any issues arrive within the next few years, this review will be updated.<br />Any questions, or if you'd like to see a photo, just leave a comment and I'll try to assist. I hope this review helps!\",\n",
